title: "transactionfee.info - Bitcoin Protocol Level Statistics"
draft: false
---

This the new version of [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info). 
The transaction fee checker has been disabled due to low usage.
As an alternative, [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) shows how much fee could have been saved by using Nested or Native SegWit.
The main focus now lies on charts about Bitcoin protocol level statistics.
Feel free to reach out if you have ideas or feedback.
