[BIP-68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) defines transactions with a version of 2.
All transactions before that were version 1 transactions.
BIP-68 was activated together with [BIP-112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) and [BIP-113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) in the [CSV-softfork early July 2016](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/21/csv-softfork-instructions/#status-of-csv-soft-fork).
It took until early 2017 for a significant number of transactions with version 2 to appear.

Version 3 transactions were introduced with [BIP-431](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0431.mediawiki) in 2024.
