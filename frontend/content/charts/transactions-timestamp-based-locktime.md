<!--more-->

Bitcoin transactions can contain a so-called time lock as a time-based validity condition.
This chart shows the percentage of transactions that are time locked to an absolute block time.

**Note:** While this chart shows the percentage of transactions with a time-based locktime the **y-axis is not in a rage between 0% and 100%**.
