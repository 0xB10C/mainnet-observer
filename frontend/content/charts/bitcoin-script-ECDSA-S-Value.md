Shows the distribution of low and high `S`-values in ECDSA signatures per day.
<!--more-->

ECDSA signatures have in theory the same probability of being _low-S_ as being _high-S_.
The [Bitcoin Core v0.9.0](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#transaction-malleability-related-fixes) release in March 2014 included a [malleability breaker](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3016) for the Bitcoin Core Wallet.
This malleability breaker made sure that all signatures generated by the Bitcoin Core wallet are _low-S_.
As the malleability problem got bigger other wallets started producing _low-S_-only-signatures as well.

With the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.10.3](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.10.3#test-for-lows-signatures-before-relaying) and [Bitcoin Core v0.11.1](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.11.1#test-for-lows-signatures-before-relaying) in October 2015 _high-s_ signatures were made non-standard to removed the transaction malleability vector.
