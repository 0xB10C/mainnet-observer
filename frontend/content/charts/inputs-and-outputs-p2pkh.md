Shows the number of P2PKH inputs and outputs per day.
<!--more-->

P2PKH (Pay-to-PubKey-Hash) inputs and outputs have been used since the early days of Bitcoin.
For a long time P2PKH was the most commonly used input and output type.
Since the activation of SegWit, P2PKH is slowly being replaced by their SegWit counter parts.
The SegWit counter parts take up less _weight_ (i.e. space) in the block and thus require lower transaction fees.
