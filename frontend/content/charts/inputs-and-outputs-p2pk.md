Shows the number of P2PK inputs and outputs per day.
<!--more-->

Pay-to-PubKey (P2PK) inputs and outputs were used in the early days of Bitcoin.
They have been replaced with Pay-To-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH) scripts.
Today transactions with P2PK [inputs](/charts/inputs-distribution) or [outputs](/charts/output-type-distribution-count) only account for a small percentage of the network activity.
