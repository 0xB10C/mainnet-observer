Shows the distribution of multisig spends for each input type per day.
<!--more-->

Between 2012 and 2015 mainly [P2MS](/charts/inputs-and-outputs-p2ms/) and [P2SH](/charts/inputs-and-outputs-p2sh/) were used as multisig input.
In 2015 and until the activation of SegWit, P2SH accounted for nearly all multisig inputs being spent.
From there on the usage of [Nested P2WSH](/charts/inputs-nested-p2wsh/), a cheaper alternative to P2SH, started taking off.
In early 2019 Nested P2WSH inputs accounted for more than 50% of all multisig inputs.
