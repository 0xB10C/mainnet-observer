Shows the distribution of low and high `r` and `S`-values in ECDSA signatures per day.
<!--more-->

ECDSA signatures have in theory the same probability of being _low-r_ as being _high-r_ and the same probability of being _low-S_ as being _high-S_.
This caused an equal distribution of low and high values until 2014.

The [Bitcoin Core v0.9.0](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#transaction-malleability-related-fixes) release in March 2014 included a [malleability breaker](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3016) for the Bitcoin Core Wallet.
This malleability breaker made sure that all signatures generated by the Bitcoin Core wallet are _low-S_.
As the malleability problem got bigger other wallets started producing _low-S_-only-signatures as well.
With the release of [Bitcoin Core v0.10.3](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.10.3#test-for-lows-signatures-before-relaying) and [Bitcoin Core v0.11.1](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.11.1#test-for-lows-signatures-before-relaying) in October 2015 _high-S_ signatures were made non-standard to removed the transaction malleability vector.

The [Bitcoin Core v0.17.0 release](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.17.0) in October 2018 included an [improvement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13666) to the wallet code that would only produce _low-r_ signatures.
This has been picked up by other wallets such as the [Electrum Bitcoin Wallet](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/pull/5820) in late 2019.
