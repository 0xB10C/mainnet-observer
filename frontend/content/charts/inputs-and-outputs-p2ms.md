Pay-to-Multisig (P2MS) is a script template for M-of-N signature transactions proposed with [BIP-11](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki) in 2011.
Only a few transactions spend P2MS inputs or pay to P2MS outputs today.
P2MS has been [mostly replaced](/charts/inputs-multisig-distribution/) with P2SH, Nested P2WSH and P2WSH multisig transactions.

More information about P2MS can be found on [learnmeabitcoin.com](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/guide/p2ms).
