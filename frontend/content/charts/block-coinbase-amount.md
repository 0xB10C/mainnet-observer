Shows the average coinbase transaction output amount.
<!--more-->

The coinbase transaction output amount is the sum of the block subsidy and the transaction fees.
This represents the amount a miner claims when finding a block.
The block subsidy halves every 210000 blocks (about every four years).
This event, called the Halvening, is clearly visible in the chart.
