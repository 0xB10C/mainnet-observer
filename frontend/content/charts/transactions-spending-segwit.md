Shows the percentage of transactions spending SegWit.

<!--more-->

A transaction is considered to be SegWit spending when it spends at least one SegWit input.
This shows the SegWit adoption on a per-transaction level.
With ongoing payment batching the [Payments-spending-SegWit](/charts/payments-spending-segwit/) metric could be more thorough.
